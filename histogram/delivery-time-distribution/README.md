# Delivery Time Distribution

This exercise visualizes the frequency distribution of delivery time in minutes among a quantity of deliveries.

1. The distribution is right-skewed
2. The bulk of the data is concetrated at 12 to 24 minutes
3. The mean would be greater than the median due to the right-skewed distribution pulling the mean upward due to the larger values being on the right
