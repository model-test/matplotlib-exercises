# Subplots (Student Dashboard)

This exercise demonstrates the use of multiple axes in a figure + customization + different graphs

- Subplot 1 (Line Plot)
  1. Test Score vs Study Time
  2. The line plot suggests the more hours of study time results in higher test scores

- Subplot 2 (Scatter Plot)
  1. Attendance vs Study Time
  2. Non-linear positive correlation between higher study hours and higher attendance

- Subplot 3 (Histogram)
  1. Score Distribution
  2. U-shaped distribution suggesting higher frequency of students either receive low failing test scores or high passing test scores

- Subplot 4 (Bar Chart)
  1. Study Group Sizes
  2. Most study groups are medium-sized
